# flutter_task

A Flutter project that as requested contains all the screens you asked for and all the functionalities as well. Of course, all screens are handled through the BloC State Management method to utilize its resources to build the application you requested in the best and most effecient way possible with a clean and neat files architecture for clear vision of the files and their functionalities. Also, the application uses a color palette that best matches the logo of ProgressSoft as a nice touch for a warn, simple, elegant, and more user friendly look. A lot of HCI principles were satisfied in the design of the application like visibility, mapping, contrast, affordance, feedback, clarity and contrast. All these principles were gracefully satisfied throughout all the screens inside the application. All sub-tasks/functionalities are apparent and working perfectly. Please find the link to both the Github Repository which contains the code and the Firebase project which I have invited the mentioned email to be an owner of it as well.

_Note_: If you want to try the OTP but don't have the ability to get SHA1 and SHA256 keys for your laptop or if your emulator not recieving sms messages, you could use the extra phone number with the assigned OTP key to it or you could add your own phone number and assign to it a special OTP key for you to register your account on and log in through and test out the application and its functionalities. You could also use the mock account I made myself. I'll leave my credentials here for you:

Finally, the home screen which returns posts through an API and has a search bar to filter the retrieving process and also highlights all the texts inside the filtered posts that match the typed text inside the search bar. You can check the profile screan which displays the logged in user details and has a log out button that navigates you back to the sign in screen.
